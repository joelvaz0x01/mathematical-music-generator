# *Fibonacci sequence* and *Golden Ratio* music

Final project developed for the Musimatics class @ [UNISA - Italy](https://www.unisa.it/)

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate that the *Fibonacci sequence* and *Golden Ratio* together can generate music.

After the execution of this project, there will be an output file called `fibonacci.mid` that have:

- *Fibonacci's sequence* on the **right hand**;
- *Golden Ratio* on the **left hand**.

Note that the main instrument on the output file will be the piano and can be changed. To make that

1. Go to file `fibonacci_music.py`;
2. Find the line `instrument = music21.instrument.Piano()`;
3. Change to the desired instrument, [see more instruments here](http://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/moduleReference/moduleInstrument.html).

To open the output file `fibonacci.mid`, you can use **music notation software programs** such as [MuseScore](https://musescore.org).
